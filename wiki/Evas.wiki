#summary Some ideas about Evas.

= Introduction =
Most of the ideas exposed here come from a couple of threads on the enlightenment-devel mailing list at [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=36565630] and [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=37463742]

= Headers =
Split huge headers ({{{Evas.h evas_common.h, etc}}}) into smaller ones.

= Data =
Evas has a very good support for data types (Lists, Hashes, Stringshare and Object Lists) and honestly Evas has a very good performance and a well defined API, most of the E-developers agree on that. But is a problem that to use this data types on your application/library you have to link against Evas even if your development has nothing to do with Evas main purpose: graphics.

= Canvas =

== Objects ==
Objects should be made loadable modules
== Obscured Rectangles ==
Areas where Evas doesn't need to redraw

== Render Pipeline (Canvas Side) ==
= Imaging =
= Engines =
Most of the engines use the software based engine and they inherit its main functions.

== Common Software Engine ==

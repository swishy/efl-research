#summary Some ideas about Ecore

= Main Design =

_Ecore_ currently has several *subsystems*, from basic data types (lists, double lists, ...) to specific purpose like _Ecore DirectFB_. As more subsystems get in the main _Ecore_, even if the different subsystems are well split (as they are now), the functionality of this library is far from its initial purpose and most of the subsystems can be another library.

= Subsystems =
== Main Ecore ==
=== Ecore Plugin ===
_Ecore Plugin_ has several functions that load modules of compiled code into memory, i.e dynamically loading of application's plugins. It is written in a very generic way, but ironically almost all applications that use _Ecore_ as their main loop handler (or just data library) and has some kind of _module_ *don't use _Ecore Plugin_ for this task but their own implementation*, namely:

(Ecore based applications/libraries)

  * Ewl
  * Etk
  * Etk Server
  * Entropy

(Not Ecore based applications/libraries)

  * Evas
  * Esmart Container
  * Imlib2

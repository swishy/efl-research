{{{
EAPI int eina_list_append(Eina_List * list, void *data);
}}}
  * Global variables but static should be underscored:
{{{
static int _my_global_bar;
}}}
  * Static functions should be underscored:
{{{
static int _my_local_func(void);
}}}
  * Functions accessible from other source files but not exported through the API should start with the project's name and then the subsystem:
{{{
Enesim_Rasterizer * enesim_rasterizer_new(void);
}}}
  * All headers files that can be included only once should have a define with the same name as the file formatted like this:
{{{
#ifndef ENESIM_PRIVATE_H_
#define ENESIM_PRIVATE_H_

#endif

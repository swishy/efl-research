#some kind of galatical domination plan, seriously :-) Ok, it's more about how to make the EFL definitively rocks.

= Data in the EFL =

As described inside [http://code.google.com/p/efl-research/wiki/EflIssues EflIssues], we have many data type around. Some optimised, some not. By merging them, we will be able to improve them on a global scale.

== The plan ==

* Move Evas data type inside Evas_Data.h.
* Introduce Eina inside EFL libs CVS.
* Provide a set of macros to replace Evas data type by Eina one.
* Add recent data type to Eina (Evas_Array, Evas_StringShare at least).
* Make Evas depend on Eina.
* Do the same for Eet data type.
* Provide a set of macros or functions that do the same for Ecore data.
* Improve Eina List allocation to do some garbage collection and reduce memory hole.
* Improve Eina List merge sort (I have a pending one on my disk that is even faster than the one we have).
* Improve Eina plugins support.
* Move Evas plugins to Eina's one.
* Move Ecore plugins to Eina's one.
